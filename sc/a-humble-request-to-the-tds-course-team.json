After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good <strong>but</strong>, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I donâ€™t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>",
