    "cooked": "<p>Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it’ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!!</p>\n<p>The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/s.anand\">@s.anand</a> sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jivraj\">@Jivraj</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/saransh_saini\">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a> I’m sure it wasn’t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions.</p>\n<p>I still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I’d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nRegards,<br>\nShivaditya Bhattacharya</p>",

This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/amit1\">@Amit1</a> back in May’24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/joy.png?v=14\" title=\":joy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joy:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.<br>\nThis course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off.<br>\nAll the best for your next term.</p>\n<p>Best Wishes<br>\nSaransh Saini<br>\nTDS TA</p>",

I had the technical background and as <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/22f3000819\">@22f3000819</a> mentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time.</p>\n<p>The best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things.</p>\n<p>Everything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/itsmealex\">@ItsMeAlex</a> , <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/trebhuvansb\">@trebhuvansb</a> , <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/23f1002382\">@23f1002382</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/22f3002933\">@22f3002933</a> for Project 2.<br>\nMy Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall “S” grade.</p>\n<p>Also I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jivraj\">@Jivraj</a> , <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/saransh_saini\">@Saransh_Saini</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a> sir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/s.anand\">@s.anand</a> sir and sir’s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective.</p>\n<p>When we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities.</p>\n<p>At last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> .</p>\n<p>Thanks &amp; Regards<br>\nPradeep Mondal</p>",
