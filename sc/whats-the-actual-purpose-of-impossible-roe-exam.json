(just by solving them properly)<br>\n<strong>Q.3:</strong> What is the knowledge, using which I can solve all 17 questions within 30 minutes (without fluking &amp; without socializing/chatting/asking (with) others)?</p>\n<p>I feel, my Q3 is little bit combination of Q2 &amp; Q1, still I am looking forward for all 3 answers separately. Please help me to understand the real essence of this ROE quiz.</p>\n<p>Thanks in anticipation,</p>",

    "cooked": "<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/ankit.jain\">@ankit.jain</a> – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.</p>\n<p><strong>What does this RoE evaluate?</strong> Implicit learning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”</li>\n<li>Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time.</p>\n<p>Some, they just CAN’T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their skill set is different.</p>\n<p>The RoE evaluates how much of learning is implicit. (Projects test how much is explicit.)</p>\n<p><strong>Can you answer 17 Q in 30 m?</strong> Hopefully not.</p>\n<p>I hope this is at the edge of the class’ competence. If multiple people answer all 17, I’ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.</p>\n<p>(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I’ve come to value frank feedback over polite encouragement.)</p>\n<p><strong>What knowledge helps solve it this fast?</strong> Practice.</p>\n<p>3 strategies help.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Consistent practice</strong>. Practice regularly. Pick problems just outside the edge of competence (fail 50% of the time).</li>\n<li><strong>Social learning</strong>. Observe experts &amp; peers and internalize their strategies. We’re social animals and learn faster through mimicry.</li>\n<li><strong>Emotional engagement</strong>. If we like it or enjoy it, we learn faster. Practicing on real-world problems or problems we enjoy solving, working with people we enjoy, helps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Maybe not.</p>\n<p>Not all implicit learning is worth it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may not need it. 10 years ago, as a data scientist, scraping was worth learning implicitly. Today, as a manager, I’d just hire someone to do it.</li>\n<li>You may not be good at it. When I got a “D” in German, followed by a “D” in Japanese, I realized I’m just not mentally wired for human languages. It’d be too much effort to learn.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RoE scores will give an idea of your implicit learning.</p>\n<p>But your time is limited. Implicit learning is costly. Please focus your time judiciously.</p>",
